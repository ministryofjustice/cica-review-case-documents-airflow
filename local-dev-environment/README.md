# Localstack local developer environment


Docker and LocalStack resorces to be created:

- [Localstack](https://www.localstack.cloud/)
- [OpenSearch](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/services/opensearch/) 
- [OpenSearch Dashboard](https://docs.opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/)
- OpenSearch Domain:```case-document-search-domain```
- Opensearch Index:```case-documents```, [setup-opensearch.sh](./init-scripts/create-opensearch-resources.sh)
- AWS resources, [setup-aws-resources.sh](./init-scripts/create-aws-resources.sh)

## Pre-requisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/)
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)
- [LocalStack Desktop](https://docs.localstack.cloud/aws/capabilities/web-app/localstack-desktop/)

## Setup

Navigate into the local-dev-environment folder 

```cd cica-review-case-documents-airflow/local-dev-enviroment```

and run

```docker compose up -d --force-recreate```

You should see 

```
:~/cica-review-case-documents-airflow/local-dev-enviroment$ docker compose up -d --force-recreate

```docker  logs localstack-main -f```

Waiting for OpenSearch domain to be created...

```
There may be a short delay whilst the domain spins up then you should see


```
OpenSearch is ready! Creating index 'case-documents'...

```

The environment is then ready to be used and the domain enpoint should be: 
```case-document-search-domain.eu-west-2.opensearch.localhost.localstack.cloud:4566```


## Docker Desktop 

If Docker Desktop has been installed you can view, pause, stop, run and view logs for the environment and the individual containers from within the Docker Desktop UI (recommended).

## Opensearch Dashboard

Navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5601/ to view the OpenSearch dashboard.

Navigate to [indices](http://127.0.0.1:5601/app/opensearch_index_management_dashboards#/indices?from=0&search=&showDataStreams=false&size=20&sortDirection=desc&sortField=index) to view the newly created index ```case-documents``` index.

Note you may need to index a document before creating an index pattern, to do so follow the instructions within the main [README](../README.md)

Create an [index pattern](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/dashboards/management/index-patterns/) name it case-documents

you can start keyword searching read the [quickstart](https://docs.opensearch.org/latest/dashboards/quickstart/)


## Integration Helper

Within the integration_helper directory you will find a number of python scripts that can be used for local development testing.
These are largely redundant now and will most likely be removed in an upcoming commit. 

Use the main application [README](../README.md) for instructions on processing a document.

put_doc.py can be used to insert a document into the local opensearch db, it uses an embedding generated by the embedding_generator.py.
search_for_doc.py searches for the inserted document using the same embedding. 

TODO: add to a local integration test suite.
